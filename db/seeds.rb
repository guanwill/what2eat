# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

  # food = Food.create([
  #   { name: '5 Cheese Pizza' },
  #   { name: 'Haiwaiian Pizza' },
  #   { name: 'Meatlovers Pizza' },
  #   { name: 'Vegetarian Pizza' },
  #   { name: 'Tandoori Chicken Pizza' },
  #   { name: 'Pepperoni Pizza' },
  #   { name: 'Margherita Pizza' },
  #   { name: 'Prawn Seafood Pizza' }])
